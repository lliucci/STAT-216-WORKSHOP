<h2>Getting a Feel for the Class and Your Role</h2>
<p>Congratulations on becoming a STAT 216 Teaching Assistant! You may
know this from your personal experience if you took STAT 216 at Montana
State University, but Teaching Assistants can make a world of difference
to students.</p>
<p>Some students, especially college freshman, may feel intimidated with
contacting a professor directly for help. That’s where you come in! Your
role as TA’s consists of aiding students in gaining a nuanced
understanding of introductory statistical methods, giving students
real-time feedback, and troubleshooting any coding issues that
arise.</p>
<p>A large part of your position is to maintain communication between
the students and lead instructors. If you see a common issues arising,
be sure to communicate this to your lead instructor so they can get
everyone on the same page and clear up any misconceptions.</p>
<div id="section-stat-216-course-materials" class="section level3">
<h3>STAT 216 Course Materials</h3>
<p>Students will be required to purchase a <strong>Coursepack</strong>
which will contain the activities and labs they will work through and
complete over the course of the semester. This will be available for
them to purchase at the MSU Bookstore.</p>
<p>There is also a <strong>Textbook</strong> for the course. Note:
<strong>The course textbook is NOT</strong> the same thing as the
coursepack! Many students confuse this, especially early on. Students
can access a free copy of the STAT 216 Textbook online. They can find
this by going to the <a
href="https://math.montana.edu/courses/s216/">STAT 216 Course page</a>
on montana.edu, through a link posted on D2L, or through a link on the
<a href="https://mtstateintrostats.github.io/SummerSyllabus/">STAT 216
Syllabus</a> which is located under <em>Course Materials and
Resources</em>. Here is a direct link to the [Online Textbook] (<a
href="https://mtstateintrostats.github.io/IntroStatTextbook/"
class="uri">https://mtstateintrostats.github.io/IntroStatTextbook/</a>)
as well.</p>
<p>The <strong>activities</strong> and <strong>labs</strong> in the
coursepack with often require students to use an RScript file to
complete. This R Bootcamp is meant to help you get a better understand
of coding in ‘R’ so you can help students when they run into issues.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-other-resources-available" class="section level3">
<h3>Other Resources Available</h3>
<p>There are a variety of other resources available for STAT 216
Students:</p>
<p><strong>1. The Mathematics and Statistics Center (MSC)</strong></p>
<p>The MSC is located on the same floor in Romney that the STAT 216
classes are held, so you can’t miss it. There are always in-house tutors
available that can help students with statistics. Students automatically
have access to the MSC through enrolling in STAT 216, and can enter for
free by swiping their CatCard. The MSC has the activity solutions so
students can check their work and get more in-depth feedback by looking
through them.</p>
<p><strong>2. SmartyCats Tutoring</strong></p>
<p>If you aren’t already aware, there are SmartyCats Tutors available
for a wide variety of MSU classes. The majority of tutors have taken the
courses before and have a good idea of the instructors expectations.
Tutoring Session only cost $2 a piece, which mean they are very
affordable for most students.</p>
<p><strong>3. Other Tutoring Opportunities</strong></p>
<p>There are multiple private tutors as well! There is a bulletin board
in the Wilson building where student tutors post their contact
information. Since Wilson is a maze and finding the bulletin board can
be intimating, students can also reach out to the math department
through email as well.</p>
<p>If a student is a Veteran or is using a relative’s Military
Educational Benefits to help pay for school, there are free statistics
tutors available to them through the Veterans Center on Campus. The
Veterans Support Center is also located in Romney, but on the first
floor.</p>

<div id="section-introduction-to-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction to R</h2>
<p>Coding can be very intimidating, especially for students with no
prior coding experience. Thus, the RScript files accompanying activities
and labs require pretty minimal amount of alterations by the students.
Students will be expected to gradually contribute more in ‘R’, but are
not expected to be expert coders at any point during the course.</p>
<p>In order to get started with <code>R</code> and <code>RStudio</code>,
it will be beneficial to understand the User Interface.
<code>RStudio</code> has the following layout:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>Editor</strong> for your scripts and documents
(top-left)<br />
</li>
<li>the <code>R</code> <strong>Console</strong> (bottom-left)<br />
</li>
<li>your <strong>Environment (Objects/Variables)/History</strong>
(top-right)<br />
</li>
<li>and your <strong>Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer</strong>
(bottom-right).</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">
<img src="rstudio.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">RStudio layout</p>
</div>
<p>The color scheme of <code>RStudio</code> can also be changed by going
to <strong>Tools –&gt; Global Options –&gt; Appearance</strong>. This
can make the long days of coding a lot easier on the eyes. Another way
to personalize <code>RStudio</code> is to change the pane layout. This
can be done in <strong>Tools –&gt; Global Options –&gt; Pane
Layout</strong>.</p>
<p>Now that <code>RStudio</code> is personalized to your specifications,
we can start diving into the basics of coding with <code>R</code>. One
of the most useful concepts is to store values as a variable. This can
be done using an arrow <code>&lt;-</code> as shown below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- 7</code></pre>
<p>We can then check the value of our variable by simply typing the name
of the variable.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 7</code></pre>
<p>We can also use <code>R</code> to do math. This can be combined with
variables to do some fun stuff.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x + x * x</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 56</code></pre>
<p>Similarly to how we store values as a variable, we can do the same
with vectors or even whole data sets! To store a vector as a variable,
write the vector inside of <code>c()</code> to let <code>R</code> know
you have a list of values. Vectors can be letters, numbers, or a
combination of the two.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>My_List &lt;- c(1, 2, &#39;lettuce&#39;, 4, &#39;tomato&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>To store a dataset in <code>R</code>, we can do something similar.
However, we must also include the function <code>read_csv()</code> from
the <code>tidyverse</code> package. We can do this to read a .csv file
(Comma Separated Values) into the environment window in
<code>R</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>RollerCoasters &lt;- read_csv(&#39;RollerCoasters.csv&#39;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Rows: 157 Columns: 15
## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Delimiter: &quot;,&quot;
## chr (8): Age_Group, Coaster, Park, City, State, Type, Design, Inversions
## dbl (7): Year_Opened, Top_Speed, Max_Height, Drop, Length, Duration, Num_of_...
## 
## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.</code></pre>
<p>When this is done, we can see some information show up in the
Console. We see how many rows and columns the dataset has as well as the
variables and their type. Variables can either be ‘double’ if they are
numbers of ‘character’ if they are words.</p>
<p>If we want to get a summary of only a certain set of rows or columns
from a dataset, we can write <code>[row,column]</code> after the dataset
to get a subset of the data frame. The <code>View()</code> function can
also be helpful to view the entire dataset.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>RollerCoasters[1:5,]</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["Age_Group"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["Coaster"],"name":[2],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["Park"],"name":[3],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["City"],"name":[4],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["State"],"name":[5],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["Type"],"name":[6],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["Design"],"name":[7],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["Year_Opened"],"name":[8],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Top_Speed"],"name":[9],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Max_Height"],"name":[10],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Drop"],"name":[11],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Length"],"name":[12],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Duration"],"name":[13],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Inversions"],"name":[14],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["Num_of_Inversions"],"name":[15],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1:older","2":"Zippin Pippin","3":"Libertyland","4":"Memphis","5":"Tennessee","6":"Wooden","7":"Sit Down","8":"1915","9":"40","10":"70","11":"70","12":"2865","13":"90","14":"N","15":"0"},{"1":"1:older","2":"Jack Rabbit","3":"Kennywood Park","4":"West Mifflin","5":"Pennsylvania","6":"Wooden","7":"Sit Down","8":"1921","9":"45","10":"40","11":"70","12":"2132","13":"96","14":"N","15":"0"},{"1":"1:older","2":"Thunderhawk","3":"Dorney Park","4":"Allentown","5":"Pennsylvania","6":"Wooden","7":"Sit Down","8":"1923","9":"45","10":"80","11":"65","12":"2767","13":"78","14":"N","15":"0"},{"1":"1:older","2":"Giant Dipper","3":"Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk","4":"Santa Cruz","5":"California","6":"Wooden","7":"Sit Down","8":"1924","9":"55","10":"70","11":"65","12":"2640","13":"112","14":"N","15":"0"},{"1":"1:older","2":"Thunderbolt","3":"Kennywood Park","4":"West Mifflin","5":"Pennsylvania","6":"Wooden","7":"Sit Down","8":"1924","9":"55","10":"70","11":"95","12":"2887","13":"101","14":"N","15":"0"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
<p>The code above is providing rows 1 through 5 of the
<code>RollerCoasters</code> dataset.</p>
<p>We can also run functions on vectors, like <code>mean()</code> or
<code>summary()</code>, that allow us to determine key information.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Counting &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

mean(Counting)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 5.5</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(Counting)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##    1.00    3.25    5.50    5.50    7.75   10.00</code></pre>
<p>Another important component to <code>R</code> is commenting on code
without affecting the code itself. This can be done by typing a pound
symbol <code>#</code> before the comment.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>2 + 2 #Look at how well R can add!</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 4</code></pre>
<p>Comments do not need to be ran for the code to work. However, it is
good practice to good documentation of your code through comments so
others can easily understand it. Comments can exist on a line alone,
after a line with a section of a function, but cannot exist between code
on the same line.</p>

<div id="section-using-packages" class="section level3">
<h3>Using Packages</h3>
<p>What is a Package in ‘R’? According to <a
href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_packages.htm">TutorialsPoint.com</a>:</p>
<p><em>“R packages are a collection of R functions, complied code and
sample data. They are stored under a directory called</em> library
<em>in the R environment. By default, R installs a set of packages
during installation. More packages are added later, when they are needed
for some specific purpose. When we start the R console, only the default
packages are available by default. Other packages which are already
installed have to be loaded explicitly to be used by the R program that
is going to use them.”</em></p>
<p>When working with packages, there are two different steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, a package must be installed onto the ‘RStudio’ server.
This step only needs to be done once.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, you must library the package to use any of the functions
in it. This must be done each time a new session in the ‘RStudio’ server
is started.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an analogy that has been extremely helpful when explaining
why students must run the ‘library( )’ codes first whenever they open an
RScript file:</p>

<div id="section-what-is-catstats" class="section level3">
<h3>What is catstats?</h3>
<p><code>catstats</code> is a package containing useful functions and
data that is designed for Stat 217 and Stat 216. For more information,
visit the <a href="https://github.com/greenwood-stat/catstats">github
repository for catstats</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-installing-catstats" class="section level3">
<h3>Installing catstats</h3>
<p>If you are running <code>RStudio</code> locally rather than from the
server, you must install <code>catstats</code>. This can be done by
first installing the <code>remotes</code> package, which allows us to
install packages from github repositories. See the code chunk below for
installing <code>remotes</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Once <code>remotes</code> is installed, we can install
<code>catstats</code> using the code below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>remotes::install_github(&quot;greenwood-stat/catstats&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-troubleshooting-common-catstats-coding-issues"
class="section level3">
<h3>Troubleshooting Common Catstats Coding Issues</h3>
<p>One of the first issues that you may run into is if a student tries
to install <code>catstats</code> without <code>remotes</code> being
installed. You may get an error code that says something along the lines
of <strong>Error in _____ : could not find function
“remotes”</strong>.</p>
<p>Another common error may be <strong>Error: Failed to install ‘unknown
package’ from GitHub</strong>. This likely means that there is a
spelling error in the path within the <code>install_github</code>
function.</p>
<p><code>catstats</code> was designed with errors in mind. That is to
say that if an error is caused, there will likely be a message that
appears in the Console window that lets the student know what might be
the problem. Make sure students are always checking spelling and error
codes if they are having issues.</p>

class="section level2">
<h2>Advice from Former STAT 216/217 TA’s for a Successful Semester</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Make sure Students are Aware of their resources EARLY
in the semester.</em></strong> The beginning of the semester can be a
bit overwhelming for everyone, so they may have trouble remembering all
of the resources available to them. If a students begins to struggle
with the material, it can be very discouraging if they are unaware of
where to go for help. Don’t hesitate to reiterate where they can find
resources, even if you think you may be getting pretty repetitive. This
also allows you to start the semester on the right foot, and students
will understand that you care about their success.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Review the activity/lab for the day prior to coming
to class!</em></strong> There is limited time when students can get real
time feedback from the instruction team, so it is crucial that you do
not waste extra time during the class period getting familiar with the
dataset or assignment questions. This is especially important if you did
not take STAT 216 at MSU.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Run through the code before the class
period.</em></strong> Chances are, if you (the TA’s) run into an error,
the students are very likely to run into it as well. If it can be caught
early, it allows for a chance to fix any errors in the code and/or
discussion of how to handle the road block when students encounter
it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Know how to Navigate any Applet that will be
used.</em></strong> Accessing the Applets, navigating the applets, and
seeing the big picture are common areas where students may run into
trouble during class. Come to class knowing how to use the relevant
Applet for the activity and be prepared to help when students get
stuck!</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Be prepared for students to ask you lots of
questions!</em></strong> As mentioned before, freshmen often feel more
comfortable asking a fellow student or TA their questions. Nobody enjoys
being belittled for asking questions, so try to encourage them when they
do. Additionally, don’t be afraid to admit if you are unsure about
something and call your lead instructor over to help.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Attend the Weekly Meetings with your lead instructor
as often as possible.</em></strong> This is a great time to touch base
with your team, communicate any subjects that are particularly
challenging, and prepare for upcoming activities and labs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Balance Validation and Instruction in your
interactions.</em></strong> It is inevitable that poorly worded or
unclear questions will occasionally arise. I (Harley) have found it
helpful to validate student’s frustrations and then guide them in the
right direction. As TA’s, we are not here to do their work for them or
give them answers. We are here to help them learn the material. When a
difficult question arises, validating their feelings is encouraging but
must also be balanced with instruction. Nobody is happy if one student
airing their grievances takes time away from you helping another
student.</p></li>
