<h2>General (harley write a better title but brain no work now)</h2>
<p>Congratulations on becoming a STAT 216 Teaching Assistant! You may
know this from your personal experience if you took STAT 216 at Montana
State University, but Teaching Assistants can make a world of difference
to students.</p>
<p>Some students, especially college freshman, may feel intimidated with
contacting a professor directly for help. That’s where you come in! Your
role as TA’s consists of aiding students in gaining a nuanced
understanding of introductory statistical methods, giving students
real-time feedback, and troubleshooting any coding issues that
arise.</p>

<h2>Introduction to R</h2>
<p>In order to get started with <code>R</code> and <code>RStudio</code>,
it will be beneficial to understand the User Interface.
<code>RStudio</code> has the following layout:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>Editor</strong> for your scripts and documents
(top-left)<br />
</li>
<li>the <code>R</code> <strong>Console</strong> (bottom-left)<br />
</li>
<li>your <strong>Environment (Objects/Variables)/History</strong>
(top-right)<br />
</li>
<li>and your <strong>Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer</strong>
(bottom-right).</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">
<img src="rstudio.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">RStudio layout</p>
</div>
<p>The color scheme of <code>RStudio</code> can also be changed by going
to <strong>Tools –&gt; Global Options –&gt; Appearance</strong>. This
can make the long days of coding a lot easier on the eyes. Another way
to personalize <code>RStudio</code> is to change the pane layout. This
can be done in <strong>Tools –&gt; Global Options –&gt; Pane
Layout</strong>.</p>
<p>Now that <code>RStudio</code> is personalized to your specifications,
we can start diving into the basics of coding with <code>R</code>. One
of the most useful concepts is to store values as a variable. This can
be done using an arrow <code>&lt;-</code> as shown below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- 7</code></pre>
<p>We can then check the value of our variable by simply typing the name
of the variable.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 7</code></pre>
<p>We can also use <code>R</code> to do math. This can be combined with
variables to do some fun stuff.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x + x * x</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 56</code></pre>
<p>Similarly to how we store values as a variable, we can do the same
with vectors or even whole data sets! To store a vector as a variable,
write the vector inside of <code>c()</code> to let <code>R</code> know
you have a list of values. Vectors can be letters, numbers, or a
combination of the two.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>My_List &lt;- c(1, 2, &#39;lettuce&#39;, 4, &#39;tomato&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>To store a dataset in <code>R</code>, we can do something similar.
However, we must also include the function <code>read_csv()</code> from
the <code>tidyverse</code> package. We can do this to read a .csv file
(Comma Separated Values) into the environment window in
<code>R</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>RollerCoasters &lt;- read_csv(&#39;RollerCoasters.csv&#39;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Rows: 157 Columns: 15
## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Delimiter: &quot;,&quot;
## chr (8): Age_Group, Coaster, Park, City, State, Type, Design, Inversions
## dbl (7): Year_Opened, Top_Speed, Max_Height, Drop, Length, Duration, Num_of_...
## 
## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.</code></pre>
<p>When this is done, we can see some information show up in the
Console. We see how many rows and columns the dataset has as well as the
variables and their type. Variables can either be ‘double’ if they are
numbers of ‘character’ if they are words.</p>
<p>If we want to get a summary of only a certain set of rows or columns
from a dataset, we can write <code>[row,column]</code> after the dataset
to get a subset of the data frame. The <code>View()</code> function can
also be helpful to view the entire dataset.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>RollerCoasters[1:5,]</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["Age_Group"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["Coaster"],"name":[2],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["Park"],"name":[3],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["City"],"name":[4],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["State"],"name":[5],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["Type"],"name":[6],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["Design"],"name":[7],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["Year_Opened"],"name":[8],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Top_Speed"],"name":[9],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Max_Height"],"name":[10],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Drop"],"name":[11],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Length"],"name":[12],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Duration"],"name":[13],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Inversions"],"name":[14],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["Num_of_Inversions"],"name":[15],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1:older","2":"Zippin Pippin","3":"Libertyland","4":"Memphis","5":"Tennessee","6":"Wooden","7":"Sit Down","8":"1915","9":"40","10":"70","11":"70","12":"2865","13":"90","14":"N","15":"0"},{"1":"1:older","2":"Jack Rabbit","3":"Kennywood Park","4":"West Mifflin","5":"Pennsylvania","6":"Wooden","7":"Sit Down","8":"1921","9":"45","10":"40","11":"70","12":"2132","13":"96","14":"N","15":"0"},{"1":"1:older","2":"Thunderhawk","3":"Dorney Park","4":"Allentown","5":"Pennsylvania","6":"Wooden","7":"Sit Down","8":"1923","9":"45","10":"80","11":"65","12":"2767","13":"78","14":"N","15":"0"},{"1":"1:older","2":"Giant Dipper","3":"Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk","4":"Santa Cruz","5":"California","6":"Wooden","7":"Sit Down","8":"1924","9":"55","10":"70","11":"65","12":"2640","13":"112","14":"N","15":"0"},{"1":"1:older","2":"Thunderbolt","3":"Kennywood Park","4":"West Mifflin","5":"Pennsylvania","6":"Wooden","7":"Sit Down","8":"1924","9":"55","10":"70","11":"95","12":"2887","13":"101","14":"N","15":"0"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
<p>The code above is providing rows 1 through 5 of the
<code>RollerCoasters</code> dataset.</p>
<p>We can also run functions on vectors, like <code>mean()</code> or
<code>summary()</code>, that allow us to determine key information.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Counting &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

mean(Counting)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 5.5</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(Counting)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##    1.00    3.25    5.50    5.50    7.75   10.00</code></pre>
<p>Another important component to <code>R</code> is commenting on code
without affecting the code itself. This can be done by typing a pound
symbol <code>#</code> before the comment.</p>
